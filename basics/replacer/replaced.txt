Copyrigh🐹 © 2007 Free Sof🐹ware Founda🐹ion, Inc. <h🐹🐹ps://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permi🐹🐹ed 🐹o copy and dis🐹ribu🐹e verba🐹im copies of 🐹his license documen🐹, bu🐹 changing i🐹 is no🐹 allowed.

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copylef🐹 license for sof🐹ware and o🐹her kinds of works.

The licenses for mos🐹 sof🐹ware and o🐹her prac🐹ical works are designed 🐹o 🐹ake away your freedom 🐹o share and change 🐹he works. By con🐹ras🐹, 🐹he GNU General Public License is in🐹ended 🐹o guaran🐹ee your freedom 🐹o share and change all versions of a program--🐹o make sure i🐹 remains free sof🐹ware for all i🐹s users. We, 🐹he Free Sof🐹ware Founda🐹ion, use 🐹he GNU General Public License for mos🐹 of our sof🐹ware; i🐹 applies also 🐹o any o🐹her work released 🐹his way by i🐹s au🐹hors. You can apply i🐹 🐹o your programs, 🐹oo.

When we speak of free sof🐹ware, we are referring 🐹o freedom, no🐹 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed 🐹o make sure 🐹ha🐹 you have 🐹he freedom 🐹o dis🐹ribu🐹e copies of free sof🐹ware (and charge for 🐹hem if you wish), 🐹ha🐹 you receive source code or can ge🐹 i🐹 if you wan🐹 i🐹, 🐹ha🐹 you can change 🐹he sof🐹ware or use pieces of i🐹 in new free programs, and 🐹ha🐹 you know you can do 🐹hese 🐹hings.

To pro🐹ec🐹 your righ🐹s, we need 🐹o preven🐹 o🐹hers from denying you 🐹hese righ🐹s or asking you 🐹o surrender 🐹he righ🐹s. Therefore, you have cer🐹ain responsibili🐹ies if you dis🐹ribu🐹e copies of 🐹he sof🐹ware, or if you modify i🐹: responsibili🐹ies 🐹o respec🐹 🐹he freedom of o🐹hers.

For example, if you dis🐹ribu🐹e copies of such a program, whe🐹her gra🐹is or for a fee, you mus🐹 pass on 🐹o 🐹he recipien🐹s 🐹he same freedoms 🐹ha🐹 you received. You mus🐹 make sure 🐹ha🐹 🐹hey, 🐹oo, receive or can ge🐹 🐹he source code. And you mus🐹 show 🐹hem 🐹hese 🐹erms so 🐹hey know 🐹heir righ🐹s.

Developers 🐹ha🐹 use 🐹he GNU GPL pro🐹ec🐹 your righ🐹s wi🐹h 🐹wo s🐹eps: (1) asser🐹 copyrigh🐹 on 🐹he sof🐹ware, and (2) offer you 🐹his License giving you legal permission 🐹o copy, dis🐹ribu🐹e and/or modify i🐹.

For 🐹he developers' and au🐹hors' pro🐹ec🐹ion, 🐹he GPL clearly explains 🐹ha🐹 🐹here is no warran🐹y for 🐹his free sof🐹ware. For bo🐹h users' and au🐹hors' sake, 🐹he GPL requires 🐹ha🐹 modified versions be marked as changed, so 🐹ha🐹 🐹heir problems will no🐹 be a🐹🐹ribu🐹ed erroneously 🐹o au🐹hors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed 🐹o deny users access 🐹o ins🐹all or run modified versions of 🐹he sof🐹ware inside 🐹hem, al🐹hough 🐹he manufac🐹urer can do so. This is fundamen🐹ally incompa🐹ible wi🐹h 🐹he aim of pro🐹ec🐹ing users' freedom 🐹o change 🐹he sof🐹ware. The sys🐹ema🐹ic pa🐹🐹ern of such abuse occurs in 🐹he area of produc🐹s for individuals 🐹o use, which is precisely where i🐹 is mos🐹 unaccep🐹able. Therefore, we have designed 🐹his version of 🐹he GPL 🐹o prohibi🐹 🐹he prac🐹ice for 🐹hose produc🐹s. If such problems arise subs🐹an🐹ially in o🐹her domains, we s🐹and ready 🐹o ex🐹end 🐹his provision 🐹o 🐹hose domains in fu🐹ure versions of 🐹he GPL, as needed 🐹o pro🐹ec🐹 🐹he freedom of users.

Finally, every program is 🐹hrea🐹ened cons🐹an🐹ly by sof🐹ware pa🐹en🐹s. S🐹a🐹es should no🐹 allow pa🐹en🐹s 🐹o res🐹ric🐹 developmen🐹 and use of sof🐹ware on general-purpose compu🐹ers, bu🐹 in 🐹hose 🐹ha🐹 do, we wish 🐹o avoid 🐹he special danger 🐹ha🐹 pa🐹en🐹s applied 🐹o a free program could make i🐹 effec🐹ively proprie🐹ary. To preven🐹 🐹his, 🐹he GPL assures 🐹ha🐹 pa🐹en🐹s canno🐹 be used 🐹o render 🐹he program non-free.

The precise 🐹erms and condi🐹ions for copying, dis🐹ribu🐹ion and modifica🐹ion follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Defini🐹ions.
“This License” refers 🐹o version 3 of 🐹he GNU General Public License.

“Copyrigh🐹” also means copyrigh🐹-like laws 🐹ha🐹 apply 🐹o o🐹her kinds of works, such as semiconduc🐹or masks.

“The Program” refers 🐹o any copyrigh🐹able work licensed under 🐹his License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipien🐹s” may be individuals or organiza🐹ions.

To “modify” a work means 🐹o copy from or adap🐹 all or par🐹 of 🐹he work in a fashion requiring copyrigh🐹 permission, o🐹her 🐹han 🐹he making of an exac🐹 copy. The resul🐹ing work is called a “modified version” of 🐹he earlier work or a work “based on” 🐹he earlier work.

A “covered work” means ei🐹her 🐹he unmodified Program or a work based on 🐹he Program.

To “propaga🐹e” a work means 🐹o do any🐹hing wi🐹h i🐹 🐹ha🐹, wi🐹hou🐹 permission, would make you direc🐹ly or secondarily liable for infringemen🐹 under applicable copyrigh🐹 law, excep🐹 execu🐹ing i🐹 on a compu🐹er or modifying a priva🐹e copy. Propaga🐹ion includes copying, dis🐹ribu🐹ion (wi🐹h or wi🐹hou🐹 modifica🐹ion), making available 🐹o 🐹he public, and in some coun🐹ries o🐹her ac🐹ivi🐹ies as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propaga🐹ion 🐹ha🐹 enables o🐹her par🐹ies 🐹o make or receive copies. Mere in🐹erac🐹ion wi🐹h a user 🐹hrough a compu🐹er ne🐹work, wi🐹h no 🐹ransfer of a copy, is no🐹 conveying.

An in🐹erac🐹ive user in🐹erface displays “Appropria🐹e Legal No🐹ices” 🐹o 🐹he ex🐹en🐹 🐹ha🐹 i🐹 includes a convenien🐹 and prominen🐹ly visible fea🐹ure 🐹ha🐹 (1) displays an appropria🐹e copyrigh🐹 no🐹ice, and (2) 🐹ells 🐹he user 🐹ha🐹 🐹here is no warran🐹y for 🐹he work (excep🐹 🐹o 🐹he ex🐹en🐹 🐹ha🐹 warran🐹ies are provided), 🐹ha🐹 licensees may convey 🐹he work under 🐹his License, and how 🐹o view a copy of 🐹his License. If 🐹he in🐹erface presen🐹s a lis🐹 of user commands or op🐹ions, such as a menu, a prominen🐹 i🐹em in 🐹he lis🐹 mee🐹s 🐹his cri🐹erion.

1. Source Code.
The “source code” for a work means 🐹he preferred form of 🐹he work for making modifica🐹ions 🐹o i🐹. “Objec🐹 code” means any non-source form of a work.

A “S🐹andard In🐹erface” means an in🐹erface 🐹ha🐹 ei🐹her is an official s🐹andard defined by a recognized s🐹andards body, or, in 🐹he case of in🐹erfaces specified for a par🐹icular programming language, one 🐹ha🐹 is widely used among developers working in 🐹ha🐹 language.

The “Sys🐹em Libraries” of an execu🐹able work include any🐹hing, o🐹her 🐹han 🐹he work as a whole, 🐹ha🐹 (a) is included in 🐹he normal form of packaging a Major Componen🐹, bu🐹 which is no🐹 par🐹 of 🐹ha🐹 Major Componen🐹, and (b) serves only 🐹o enable use of 🐹he work wi🐹h 🐹ha🐹 Major Componen🐹, or 🐹o implemen🐹 a S🐹andard In🐹erface for which an implemen🐹a🐹ion is available 🐹o 🐹he public in source code form. A “Major Componen🐹”, in 🐹his con🐹ex🐹, means a major essen🐹ial componen🐹 (kernel, window sys🐹em, and so on) of 🐹he specific opera🐹ing sys🐹em (if any) on which 🐹he execu🐹able work runs, or a compiler used 🐹o produce 🐹he work, or an objec🐹 code in🐹erpre🐹er used 🐹o run i🐹.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in objec🐹 code form means all 🐹he source code needed 🐹o genera🐹e, ins🐹all, and (for an execu🐹able work) run 🐹he objec🐹 code and 🐹o modify 🐹he work, including scrip🐹s 🐹o con🐹rol 🐹hose ac🐹ivi🐹ies. However, i🐹 does no🐹 include 🐹he work's Sys🐹em Libraries, or general-purpose 🐹ools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing 🐹hose ac🐹ivi🐹ies bu🐹 which are no🐹 par🐹 of 🐹he work. For example, Corresponding Source includes in🐹erface defini🐹ion files associa🐹ed wi🐹h source files for 🐹he work, and 🐹he source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms 🐹ha🐹 🐹he work is specifically designed 🐹o require, such as by in🐹ima🐹e da🐹a communica🐹ion or con🐹rol flow be🐹ween 🐹hose subprograms and o🐹her par🐹s of 🐹he work.

The Corresponding Source need no🐹 include any🐹hing 🐹ha🐹 users can regenera🐹e au🐹oma🐹ically from o🐹her par🐹s of 🐹he Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is 🐹ha🐹 same work.

2. Basic Permissions.
All righ🐹s gran🐹ed under 🐹his License are gran🐹ed for 🐹he 🐹erm of copyrigh🐹 on 🐹he Program, and are irrevocable provided 🐹he s🐹a🐹ed condi🐹ions are me🐹. This License explici🐹ly affirms your unlimi🐹ed permission 🐹o run 🐹he unmodified Program. The ou🐹pu🐹 from running a covered work is covered by 🐹his License only if 🐹he ou🐹pu🐹, given i🐹s con🐹en🐹, cons🐹i🐹u🐹es a covered work. This License acknowledges your righ🐹s of fair use or o🐹her equivalen🐹, as provided by copyrigh🐹 law.

You may make, run and propaga🐹e covered works 🐹ha🐹 you do no🐹 convey, wi🐹hou🐹 condi🐹ions so long as your license o🐹herwise remains in force. You may convey covered works 🐹o o🐹hers for 🐹he sole purpose of having 🐹hem make modifica🐹ions exclusively for you, or provide you wi🐹h facili🐹ies for running 🐹hose works, provided 🐹ha🐹 you comply wi🐹h 🐹he 🐹erms of 🐹his License in conveying all ma🐹erial for which you do no🐹 con🐹rol copyrigh🐹. Those 🐹hus making or running 🐹he covered works for you mus🐹 do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direc🐹ion and con🐹rol, on 🐹erms 🐹ha🐹 prohibi🐹 🐹hem from making any copies of your copyrigh🐹ed ma🐹erial ou🐹side 🐹heir rela🐹ionship wi🐹h you.

Conveying under any o🐹her circums🐹ances is permi🐹🐹ed solely under 🐹he condi🐹ions s🐹a🐹ed below. Sublicensing is no🐹 allowed; sec🐹ion 10 makes i🐹 unnecessary.

3. Pro🐹ec🐹ing Users' Legal Righ🐹s From An🐹i-Circumven🐹ion Law.
No covered work shall be deemed par🐹 of an effec🐹ive 🐹echnological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obliga🐹ions under ar🐹icle 11 of 🐹he WIPO copyrigh🐹 🐹rea🐹y adop🐹ed on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibi🐹ing or res🐹ric🐹ing circumven🐹ion of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power 🐹o forbid circumven🐹ion of 🐹echnological measures 🐹o 🐹he ex🐹en🐹 such circumven🐹ion is effec🐹ed by exercising righ🐹s under 🐹his License wi🐹h respec🐹 🐹o 🐹he covered work, and you disclaim any in🐹en🐹ion 🐹o limi🐹 opera🐹ion or modifica🐹ion of 🐹he work as a means of enforcing, agains🐹 🐹he work's users, your or 🐹hird par🐹ies' legal righ🐹s 🐹o forbid circumven🐹ion of 🐹echnological measures.

4. Conveying Verba🐹im Copies.
You may convey verba🐹im copies of 🐹he Program's source code as you receive i🐹, in any medium, provided 🐹ha🐹 you conspicuously and appropria🐹ely publish on each copy an appropria🐹e copyrigh🐹 no🐹ice; keep in🐹ac🐹 all no🐹ices s🐹a🐹ing 🐹ha🐹 🐹his License and any non-permissive 🐹erms added in accord wi🐹h sec🐹ion 7 apply 🐹o 🐹he code; keep in🐹ac🐹 all no🐹ices of 🐹he absence of any warran🐹y; and give all recipien🐹s a copy of 🐹his License along wi🐹h 🐹he Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy 🐹ha🐹 you convey, and you may offer suppor🐹 or warran🐹y pro🐹ec🐹ion for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
You may convey a work based on 🐹he Program, or 🐹he modifica🐹ions 🐹o produce i🐹 from 🐹he Program, in 🐹he form of source code under 🐹he 🐹erms of sec🐹ion 4, provided 🐹ha🐹 you also mee🐹 all of 🐹hese condi🐹ions:

a) The work mus🐹 carry prominen🐹 no🐹ices s🐹a🐹ing 🐹ha🐹 you modified i🐹, and giving a relevan🐹 da🐹e.
b) The work mus🐹 carry prominen🐹 no🐹ices s🐹a🐹ing 🐹ha🐹 i🐹 is released under 🐹his License and any condi🐹ions added under sec🐹ion 7. This requiremen🐹 modifies 🐹he requiremen🐹 in sec🐹ion 4 🐹o “keep in🐹ac🐹 all no🐹ices”.
c) You mus🐹 license 🐹he en🐹ire work, as a whole, under 🐹his License 🐹o anyone who comes in🐹o possession of a copy. This License will 🐹herefore apply, along wi🐹h any applicable sec🐹ion 7 addi🐹ional 🐹erms, 🐹o 🐹he whole of 🐹he work, and all i🐹s par🐹s, regardless of how 🐹hey are packaged. This License gives no permission 🐹o license 🐹he work in any o🐹her way, bu🐹 i🐹 does no🐹 invalida🐹e such permission if you have separa🐹ely received i🐹.
d) If 🐹he work has in🐹erac🐹ive user in🐹erfaces, each mus🐹 display Appropria🐹e Legal No🐹ices; however, if 🐹he Program has in🐹erac🐹ive in🐹erfaces 🐹ha🐹 do no🐹 display Appropria🐹e Legal No🐹ices, your work need no🐹 make 🐹hem do so.
A compila🐹ion of a covered work wi🐹h o🐹her separa🐹e and independen🐹 works, which are no🐹 by 🐹heir na🐹ure ex🐹ensions of 🐹he covered work, and which are no🐹 combined wi🐹h i🐹 such as 🐹o form a larger program, in or on a volume of a s🐹orage or dis🐹ribu🐹ion medium, is called an “aggrega🐹e” if 🐹he compila🐹ion and i🐹s resul🐹ing copyrigh🐹 are no🐹 used 🐹o limi🐹 🐹he access or legal righ🐹s of 🐹he compila🐹ion's users beyond wha🐹 🐹he individual works permi🐹. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggrega🐹e does no🐹 cause 🐹his License 🐹o apply 🐹o 🐹he o🐹her par🐹s of 🐹he aggrega🐹e.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
You may convey a covered work in objec🐹 code form under 🐹he 🐹erms of sec🐹ions 4 and 5, provided 🐹ha🐹 you also convey 🐹he machine-readable Corresponding Source under 🐹he 🐹erms of 🐹his License, in one of 🐹hese ways:

a) Convey 🐹he objec🐹 code in, or embodied in, a physical produc🐹 (including a physical dis🐹ribu🐹ion medium), accompanied by 🐹he Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium cus🐹omarily used for sof🐹ware in🐹erchange.
b) Convey 🐹he objec🐹 code in, or embodied in, a physical produc🐹 (including a physical dis🐹ribu🐹ion medium), accompanied by a wri🐹🐹en offer, valid for a🐹 leas🐹 🐹hree years and valid for as long as you offer spare par🐹s or cus🐹omer suppor🐹 for 🐹ha🐹 produc🐹 model, 🐹o give anyone who possesses 🐹he objec🐹 code ei🐹her (1) a copy of 🐹he Corresponding Source for all 🐹he sof🐹ware in 🐹he produc🐹 🐹ha🐹 is covered by 🐹his License, on a durable physical medium cus🐹omarily used for sof🐹ware in🐹erchange, for a price no more 🐹han your reasonable cos🐹 of physically performing 🐹his conveying of source, or (2) access 🐹o copy 🐹he Corresponding Source from a ne🐹work server a🐹 no charge.
c) Convey individual copies of 🐹he objec🐹 code wi🐹h a copy of 🐹he wri🐹🐹en offer 🐹o provide 🐹he Corresponding Source. This al🐹erna🐹ive is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received 🐹he objec🐹 code wi🐹h such an offer, in accord wi🐹h subsec🐹ion 6b.
d) Convey 🐹he objec🐹 code by offering access from a designa🐹ed place (gra🐹is or for a charge), and offer equivalen🐹 access 🐹o 🐹he Corresponding Source in 🐹he same way 🐹hrough 🐹he same place a🐹 no fur🐹her charge. You need no🐹 require recipien🐹s 🐹o copy 🐹he Corresponding Source along wi🐹h 🐹he objec🐹 code. If 🐹he place 🐹o copy 🐹he objec🐹 code is a ne🐹work server, 🐹he Corresponding Source may be on a differen🐹 server (opera🐹ed by you or a 🐹hird par🐹y) 🐹ha🐹 suppor🐹s equivalen🐹 copying facili🐹ies, provided you main🐹ain clear direc🐹ions nex🐹 🐹o 🐹he objec🐹 code saying where 🐹o find 🐹he Corresponding Source. Regardless of wha🐹 server hos🐹s 🐹he Corresponding Source, you remain obliga🐹ed 🐹o ensure 🐹ha🐹 i🐹 is available for as long as needed 🐹o sa🐹isfy 🐹hese requiremen🐹s.
e) Convey 🐹he objec🐹 code using peer-🐹o-peer 🐹ransmission, provided you inform o🐹her peers where 🐹he objec🐹 code and Corresponding Source of 🐹he work are being offered 🐹o 🐹he general public a🐹 no charge under subsec🐹ion 6d.
A separable por🐹ion of 🐹he objec🐹 code, whose source code is excluded from 🐹he Corresponding Source as a Sys🐹em Library, need no🐹 be included in conveying 🐹he objec🐹 code work.

A “User Produc🐹” is ei🐹her (1) a “consumer produc🐹”, which means any 🐹angible personal proper🐹y which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) any🐹hing designed or sold for incorpora🐹ion in🐹o a dwelling. In de🐹ermining whe🐹her a produc🐹 is a consumer produc🐹, doub🐹ful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a par🐹icular produc🐹 received by a par🐹icular user, “normally used” refers 🐹o a 🐹ypical or common use of 🐹ha🐹 class of produc🐹, regardless of 🐹he s🐹a🐹us of 🐹he par🐹icular user or of 🐹he way in which 🐹he par🐹icular user ac🐹ually uses, or expec🐹s or is expec🐹ed 🐹o use, 🐹he produc🐹. A produc🐹 is a consumer produc🐹 regardless of whe🐹her 🐹he produc🐹 has subs🐹an🐹ial commercial, indus🐹rial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represen🐹 🐹he only significan🐹 mode of use of 🐹he produc🐹.

“Ins🐹alla🐹ion Informa🐹ion” for a User Produc🐹 means any me🐹hods, procedures, au🐹horiza🐹ion keys, or o🐹her informa🐹ion required 🐹o ins🐹all and execu🐹e modified versions of a covered work in 🐹ha🐹 User Produc🐹 from a modified version of i🐹s Corresponding Source. The informa🐹ion mus🐹 suffice 🐹o ensure 🐹ha🐹 🐹he con🐹inued func🐹ioning of 🐹he modified objec🐹 code is in no case preven🐹ed or in🐹erfered wi🐹h solely because modifica🐹ion has been made.

If you convey an objec🐹 code work under 🐹his sec🐹ion in, or wi🐹h, or specifically for use in, a User Produc🐹, and 🐹he conveying occurs as par🐹 of a 🐹ransac🐹ion in which 🐹he righ🐹 of possession and use of 🐹he User Produc🐹 is 🐹ransferred 🐹o 🐹he recipien🐹 in perpe🐹ui🐹y or for a fixed 🐹erm (regardless of how 🐹he 🐹ransac🐹ion is charac🐹erized), 🐹he Corresponding Source conveyed under 🐹his sec🐹ion mus🐹 be accompanied by 🐹he Ins🐹alla🐹ion Informa🐹ion. Bu🐹 🐹his requiremen🐹 does no🐹 apply if nei🐹her you nor any 🐹hird par🐹y re🐹ains 🐹he abili🐹y 🐹o ins🐹all modified objec🐹 code on 🐹he User Produc🐹 (for example, 🐹he work has been ins🐹alled in ROM).

The requiremen🐹 🐹o provide Ins🐹alla🐹ion Informa🐹ion does no🐹 include a requiremen🐹 🐹o con🐹inue 🐹o provide suppor🐹 service, warran🐹y, or upda🐹es for a work 🐹ha🐹 has been modified or ins🐹alled by 🐹he recipien🐹, or for 🐹he User Produc🐹 in which i🐹 has been modified or ins🐹alled. Access 🐹o a ne🐹work may be denied when 🐹he modifica🐹ion i🐹self ma🐹erially and adversely affec🐹s 🐹he opera🐹ion of 🐹he ne🐹work or viola🐹es 🐹he rules and pro🐹ocols for communica🐹ion across 🐹he ne🐹work.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Ins🐹alla🐹ion Informa🐹ion provided, in accord wi🐹h 🐹his sec🐹ion mus🐹 be in a forma🐹 🐹ha🐹 is publicly documen🐹ed (and wi🐹h an implemen🐹a🐹ion available 🐹o 🐹he public in source code form), and mus🐹 require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Addi🐹ional Terms.
“Addi🐹ional permissions” are 🐹erms 🐹ha🐹 supplemen🐹 🐹he 🐹erms of 🐹his License by making excep🐹ions from one or more of i🐹s condi🐹ions. Addi🐹ional permissions 🐹ha🐹 are applicable 🐹o 🐹he en🐹ire Program shall be 🐹rea🐹ed as 🐹hough 🐹hey were included in 🐹his License, 🐹o 🐹he ex🐹en🐹 🐹ha🐹 🐹hey are valid under applicable law. If addi🐹ional permissions apply only 🐹o par🐹 of 🐹he Program, 🐹ha🐹 par🐹 may be used separa🐹ely under 🐹hose permissions, bu🐹 🐹he en🐹ire Program remains governed by 🐹his License wi🐹hou🐹 regard 🐹o 🐹he addi🐹ional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may a🐹 your op🐹ion remove any addi🐹ional permissions from 🐹ha🐹 copy, or from any par🐹 of i🐹. (Addi🐹ional permissions may be wri🐹🐹en 🐹o require 🐹heir own removal in cer🐹ain cases when you modify 🐹he work.) You may place addi🐹ional permissions on ma🐹erial, added by you 🐹o a covered work, for which you have or can give appropria🐹e copyrigh🐹 permission.

No🐹wi🐹hs🐹anding any o🐹her provision of 🐹his License, for ma🐹erial you add 🐹o a covered work, you may (if au🐹horized by 🐹he copyrigh🐹 holders of 🐹ha🐹 ma🐹erial) supplemen🐹 🐹he 🐹erms of 🐹his License wi🐹h 🐹erms:

a) Disclaiming warran🐹y or limi🐹ing liabili🐹y differen🐹ly from 🐹he 🐹erms of sec🐹ions 15 and 16 of 🐹his License; or
b) Requiring preserva🐹ion of specified reasonable legal no🐹ices or au🐹hor a🐹🐹ribu🐹ions in 🐹ha🐹 ma🐹erial or in 🐹he Appropria🐹e Legal No🐹ices displayed by works con🐹aining i🐹; or
c) Prohibi🐹ing misrepresen🐹a🐹ion of 🐹he origin of 🐹ha🐹 ma🐹erial, or requiring 🐹ha🐹 modified versions of such ma🐹erial be marked in reasonable ways as differen🐹 from 🐹he original version; or
d) Limi🐹ing 🐹he use for publici🐹y purposes of names of licensors or au🐹hors of 🐹he ma🐹erial; or
e) Declining 🐹o gran🐹 righ🐹s under 🐹rademark law for use of some 🐹rade names, 🐹rademarks, or service marks; or
f) Requiring indemnifica🐹ion of licensors and au🐹hors of 🐹ha🐹 ma🐹erial by anyone who conveys 🐹he ma🐹erial (or modified versions of i🐹) wi🐹h con🐹rac🐹ual assump🐹ions of liabili🐹y 🐹o 🐹he recipien🐹, for any liabili🐹y 🐹ha🐹 🐹hese con🐹rac🐹ual assump🐹ions direc🐹ly impose on 🐹hose licensors and au🐹hors.
All o🐹her non-permissive addi🐹ional 🐹erms are considered “fur🐹her res🐹ric🐹ions” wi🐹hin 🐹he meaning of sec🐹ion 10. If 🐹he Program as you received i🐹, or any par🐹 of i🐹, con🐹ains a no🐹ice s🐹a🐹ing 🐹ha🐹 i🐹 is governed by 🐹his License along wi🐹h a 🐹erm 🐹ha🐹 is a fur🐹her res🐹ric🐹ion, you may remove 🐹ha🐹 🐹erm. If a license documen🐹 con🐹ains a fur🐹her res🐹ric🐹ion bu🐹 permi🐹s relicensing or conveying under 🐹his License, you may add 🐹o a covered work ma🐹erial governed by 🐹he 🐹erms of 🐹ha🐹 license documen🐹, provided 🐹ha🐹 🐹he fur🐹her res🐹ric🐹ion does no🐹 survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add 🐹erms 🐹o a covered work in accord wi🐹h 🐹his sec🐹ion, you mus🐹 place, in 🐹he relevan🐹 source files, a s🐹a🐹emen🐹 of 🐹he addi🐹ional 🐹erms 🐹ha🐹 apply 🐹o 🐹hose files, or a no🐹ice indica🐹ing where 🐹o find 🐹he applicable 🐹erms.

Addi🐹ional 🐹erms, permissive or non-permissive, may be s🐹a🐹ed in 🐹he form of a separa🐹ely wri🐹🐹en license, or s🐹a🐹ed as excep🐹ions; 🐹he above requiremen🐹s apply ei🐹her way.

8. Termina🐹ion.
You may no🐹 propaga🐹e or modify a covered work excep🐹 as expressly provided under 🐹his License. Any a🐹🐹emp🐹 o🐹herwise 🐹o propaga🐹e or modify i🐹 is void, and will au🐹oma🐹ically 🐹ermina🐹e your righ🐹s under 🐹his License (including any pa🐹en🐹 licenses gran🐹ed under 🐹he 🐹hird paragraph of sec🐹ion 11).

However, if you cease all viola🐹ion of 🐹his License, 🐹hen your license from a par🐹icular copyrigh🐹 holder is reins🐹a🐹ed (a) provisionally, unless and un🐹il 🐹he copyrigh🐹 holder explici🐹ly and finally 🐹ermina🐹es your license, and (b) permanen🐹ly, if 🐹he copyrigh🐹 holder fails 🐹o no🐹ify you of 🐹he viola🐹ion by some reasonable means prior 🐹o 60 days af🐹er 🐹he cessa🐹ion.

Moreover, your license from a par🐹icular copyrigh🐹 holder is reins🐹a🐹ed permanen🐹ly if 🐹he copyrigh🐹 holder no🐹ifies you of 🐹he viola🐹ion by some reasonable means, 🐹his is 🐹he firs🐹 🐹ime you have received no🐹ice of viola🐹ion of 🐹his License (for any work) from 🐹ha🐹 copyrigh🐹 holder, and you cure 🐹he viola🐹ion prior 🐹o 30 days af🐹er your receip🐹 of 🐹he no🐹ice.

Termina🐹ion of your righ🐹s under 🐹his sec🐹ion does no🐹 🐹ermina🐹e 🐹he licenses of par🐹ies who have received copies or righ🐹s from you under 🐹his License. If your righ🐹s have been 🐹ermina🐹ed and no🐹 permanen🐹ly reins🐹a🐹ed, you do no🐹 qualify 🐹o receive new licenses for 🐹he same ma🐹erial under sec🐹ion 10.

9. Accep🐹ance No🐹 Required for Having Copies.
You are no🐹 required 🐹o accep🐹 🐹his License in order 🐹o receive or run a copy of 🐹he Program. Ancillary propaga🐹ion of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-🐹o-peer 🐹ransmission 🐹o receive a copy likewise does no🐹 require accep🐹ance. However, no🐹hing o🐹her 🐹han 🐹his License gran🐹s you permission 🐹o propaga🐹e or modify any covered work. These ac🐹ions infringe copyrigh🐹 if you do no🐹 accep🐹 🐹his License. Therefore, by modifying or propaga🐹ing a covered work, you indica🐹e your accep🐹ance of 🐹his License 🐹o do so.

10. Au🐹oma🐹ic Licensing of Downs🐹ream Recipien🐹s.
Each 🐹ime you convey a covered work, 🐹he recipien🐹 au🐹oma🐹ically receives a license from 🐹he original licensors, 🐹o run, modify and propaga🐹e 🐹ha🐹 work, subjec🐹 🐹o 🐹his License. You are no🐹 responsible for enforcing compliance by 🐹hird par🐹ies wi🐹h 🐹his License.

An “en🐹i🐹y 🐹ransac🐹ion” is a 🐹ransac🐹ion 🐹ransferring con🐹rol of an organiza🐹ion, or subs🐹an🐹ially all asse🐹s of one, or subdividing an organiza🐹ion, or merging organiza🐹ions. If propaga🐹ion of a covered work resul🐹s from an en🐹i🐹y 🐹ransac🐹ion, each par🐹y 🐹o 🐹ha🐹 🐹ransac🐹ion who receives a copy of 🐹he work also receives wha🐹ever licenses 🐹o 🐹he work 🐹he par🐹y's predecessor in in🐹eres🐹 had or could give under 🐹he previous paragraph, plus a righ🐹 🐹o possession of 🐹he Corresponding Source of 🐹he work from 🐹he predecessor in in🐹eres🐹, if 🐹he predecessor has i🐹 or can ge🐹 i🐹 wi🐹h reasonable effor🐹s.

You may no🐹 impose any fur🐹her res🐹ric🐹ions on 🐹he exercise of 🐹he righ🐹s gran🐹ed or affirmed under 🐹his License. For example, you may no🐹 impose a license fee, royal🐹y, or o🐹her charge for exercise of righ🐹s gran🐹ed under 🐹his License, and you may no🐹 ini🐹ia🐹e li🐹iga🐹ion (including a cross-claim or coun🐹erclaim in a lawsui🐹) alleging 🐹ha🐹 any pa🐹en🐹 claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or impor🐹ing 🐹he Program or any por🐹ion of i🐹.

11. Pa🐹en🐹s.
A “con🐹ribu🐹or” is a copyrigh🐹 holder who au🐹horizes use under 🐹his License of 🐹he Program or a work on which 🐹he Program is based. The work 🐹hus licensed is called 🐹he con🐹ribu🐹or's “con🐹ribu🐹or version”.

A con🐹ribu🐹or's “essen🐹ial pa🐹en🐹 claims” are all pa🐹en🐹 claims owned or con🐹rolled by 🐹he con🐹ribu🐹or, whe🐹her already acquired or hereaf🐹er acquired, 🐹ha🐹 would be infringed by some manner, permi🐹🐹ed by 🐹his License, of making, using, or selling i🐹s con🐹ribu🐹or version, bu🐹 do no🐹 include claims 🐹ha🐹 would be infringed only as a consequence of fur🐹her modifica🐹ion of 🐹he con🐹ribu🐹or version. For purposes of 🐹his defini🐹ion, “con🐹rol” includes 🐹he righ🐹 🐹o gran🐹 pa🐹en🐹 sublicenses in a manner consis🐹en🐹 wi🐹h 🐹he requiremen🐹s of 🐹his License.

Each con🐹ribu🐹or gran🐹s you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royal🐹y-free pa🐹en🐹 license under 🐹he con🐹ribu🐹or's essen🐹ial pa🐹en🐹 claims, 🐹o make, use, sell, offer for sale, impor🐹 and o🐹herwise run, modify and propaga🐹e 🐹he con🐹en🐹s of i🐹s con🐹ribu🐹or version.

In 🐹he following 🐹hree paragraphs, a “pa🐹en🐹 license” is any express agreemen🐹 or commi🐹men🐹, however denomina🐹ed, no🐹 🐹o enforce a pa🐹en🐹 (such as an express permission 🐹o prac🐹ice a pa🐹en🐹 or covenan🐹 no🐹 🐹o sue for pa🐹en🐹 infringemen🐹). To “gran🐹” such a pa🐹en🐹 license 🐹o a par🐹y means 🐹o make such an agreemen🐹 or commi🐹men🐹 no🐹 🐹o enforce a pa🐹en🐹 agains🐹 🐹he par🐹y.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a pa🐹en🐹 license, and 🐹he Corresponding Source of 🐹he work is no🐹 available for anyone 🐹o copy, free of charge and under 🐹he 🐹erms of 🐹his License, 🐹hrough a publicly available ne🐹work server or o🐹her readily accessible means, 🐹hen you mus🐹 ei🐹her (1) cause 🐹he Corresponding Source 🐹o be so available, or (2) arrange 🐹o deprive yourself of 🐹he benefi🐹 of 🐹he pa🐹en🐹 license for 🐹his par🐹icular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consis🐹en🐹 wi🐹h 🐹he requiremen🐹s of 🐹his License, 🐹o ex🐹end 🐹he pa🐹en🐹 license 🐹o downs🐹ream recipien🐹s. “Knowingly relying” means you have ac🐹ual knowledge 🐹ha🐹, bu🐹 for 🐹he pa🐹en🐹 license, your conveying 🐹he covered work in a coun🐹ry, or your recipien🐹's use of 🐹he covered work in a coun🐹ry, would infringe one or more iden🐹ifiable pa🐹en🐹s in 🐹ha🐹 coun🐹ry 🐹ha🐹 you have reason 🐹o believe are valid.

If, pursuan🐹 🐹o or in connec🐹ion wi🐹h a single 🐹ransac🐹ion or arrangemen🐹, you convey, or propaga🐹e by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and gran🐹 a pa🐹en🐹 license 🐹o some of 🐹he par🐹ies receiving 🐹he covered work au🐹horizing 🐹hem 🐹o use, propaga🐹e, modify or convey a specific copy of 🐹he covered work, 🐹hen 🐹he pa🐹en🐹 license you gran🐹 is au🐹oma🐹ically ex🐹ended 🐹o all recipien🐹s of 🐹he covered work and works based on i🐹.

A pa🐹en🐹 license is “discrimina🐹ory” if i🐹 does no🐹 include wi🐹hin 🐹he scope of i🐹s coverage, prohibi🐹s 🐹he exercise of, or is condi🐹ioned on 🐹he non-exercise of one or more of 🐹he righ🐹s 🐹ha🐹 are specifically gran🐹ed under 🐹his License. You may no🐹 convey a covered work if you are a par🐹y 🐹o an arrangemen🐹 wi🐹h a 🐹hird par🐹y 🐹ha🐹 is in 🐹he business of dis🐹ribu🐹ing sof🐹ware, under which you make paymen🐹 🐹o 🐹he 🐹hird par🐹y based on 🐹he ex🐹en🐹 of your ac🐹ivi🐹y of conveying 🐹he work, and under which 🐹he 🐹hird par🐹y gran🐹s, 🐹o any of 🐹he par🐹ies who would receive 🐹he covered work from you, a discrimina🐹ory pa🐹en🐹 license (a) in connec🐹ion wi🐹h copies of 🐹he covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from 🐹hose copies), or (b) primarily for and in connec🐹ion wi🐹h specific produc🐹s or compila🐹ions 🐹ha🐹 con🐹ain 🐹he covered work, unless you en🐹ered in🐹o 🐹ha🐹 arrangemen🐹, or 🐹ha🐹 pa🐹en🐹 license was gran🐹ed, prior 🐹o 28 March 2007.

No🐹hing in 🐹his License shall be cons🐹rued as excluding or limi🐹ing any implied license or o🐹her defenses 🐹o infringemen🐹 🐹ha🐹 may o🐹herwise be available 🐹o you under applicable pa🐹en🐹 law.

12. No Surrender of O🐹hers' Freedom.
If condi🐹ions are imposed on you (whe🐹her by cour🐹 order, agreemen🐹 or o🐹herwise) 🐹ha🐹 con🐹radic🐹 🐹he condi🐹ions of 🐹his License, 🐹hey do no🐹 excuse you from 🐹he condi🐹ions of 🐹his License. If you canno🐹 convey a covered work so as 🐹o sa🐹isfy simul🐹aneously your obliga🐹ions under 🐹his License and any o🐹her per🐹inen🐹 obliga🐹ions, 🐹hen as a consequence you may no🐹 convey i🐹 a🐹 all. For example, if you agree 🐹o 🐹erms 🐹ha🐹 obliga🐹e you 🐹o collec🐹 a royal🐹y for fur🐹her conveying from 🐹hose 🐹o whom you convey 🐹he Program, 🐹he only way you could sa🐹isfy bo🐹h 🐹hose 🐹erms and 🐹his License would be 🐹o refrain en🐹irely from conveying 🐹he Program.

13. Use wi🐹h 🐹he GNU Affero General Public License.

The 🐹erms of 🐹his License will con🐹inue 🐹o apply 🐹o 🐹he par🐹 which is 🐹he covered work, bu🐹 🐹he special requiremen🐹s of 🐹he GNU Affero General Public License, sec🐹ion 13, concerning in🐹erac🐹ion 🐹hrough a ne🐹work will apply 🐹o 🐹he combina🐹ion as such.

14. Revised Versions of 🐹his License.
The Free Sof🐹ware Founda🐹ion may publish revised and/or new versions of 🐹he GNU General Public License from 🐹ime 🐹o 🐹ime. Such new versions will be similar in spiri🐹 🐹o 🐹he presen🐹 version, bu🐹 may differ in de🐹ail 🐹o address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a dis🐹inguishing version number. If 🐹he Program specifies 🐹ha🐹 a cer🐹ain numbered version of 🐹he GNU General Public License “or any la🐹er version” applies 🐹o i🐹, you have 🐹he op🐹ion of following 🐹he 🐹erms and condi🐹ions ei🐹her of 🐹ha🐹 numbered version or of any la🐹er version published by 🐹he Free Sof🐹ware Founda🐹ion. If 🐹he Program does no🐹 specify a version number of 🐹he GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by 🐹he Free Sof🐹ware Founda🐹ion.

If 🐹he Program specifies 🐹ha🐹 a proxy can decide which fu🐹ure versions of 🐹he GNU General Public License can be used, 🐹ha🐹 proxy's public s🐹a🐹emen🐹 of accep🐹ance of a version permanen🐹ly au🐹horizes you 🐹o choose 🐹ha🐹 version for 🐹he Program.

La🐹er license versions may give you addi🐹ional or differen🐹 permissions. However, no addi🐹ional obliga🐹ions are imposed on any au🐹hor or copyrigh🐹 holder as a resul🐹 of your choosing 🐹o follow a la🐹er version.
